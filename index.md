## Mozilla Israel online 
{: data-timing="00:10" #online}

We are running three domains and two websites –

* [mozilla.org.il](#mozillaorgil)
* [firefox.co.il](#firefoxcoil) / firefox.org.il
* In addition, we have localized [mozilla.org](#mozillaorghe)…

## firefox.co.il 
{: data-timing="00:10"}

[![firefox.co.il](images/firefox.co.il.png)](http://firefox.co.il)
{: style="width: 66%; float: right; "}

* [firefox.co.il](http://firefox.co.il)
A domain that was donated to us. Acts as a landing page and doesn't have its own content besides mozilla.org with some localized links on top
* [firefox.org.il](http://firefox.org.il)
A domain that was donated to us. Links to mozilla.org. We don't really have an idea what to place there…



## mozilla.org.il 
{: data-timing="00:10"}

Our main site. Has a news section (based on WordPress) and an active support forum (phpBB).

[![Screenshot of mozilla.org.il](images/mozilla-il_website.png)](http://mozilla.org.il)
{: style="width: 66%"}

## mozilla.org.il (on-going development site)
{: data-timing="00:10"}
The site has a few static pages which are outdated for few years now, but we placed a script that update version information and download links based on the products version API from mozilla.org.

We want to convert the site to the new design at some point in the future and update some of the site content.
