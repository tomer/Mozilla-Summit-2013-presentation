## Firefox OS

* Barely used in Israel although some fanatics owns FirefoxOS devices, and there is geeks interested in buying such devices.
* Mozilla Israel members has few Keon devices. We use them to demo Firefox OS in various events. We are considering planning a Firefox OS hackathon.

## Mozilla Israel in local events

## August Penguin

* [August Penguin][ap] is an annual multi-track users and developers conference dedicated to the local Open Source/Free Software community.
* We demonstrated during the conference the advantages of Firefox for Android and Firefox OS, and held some talks with developers about the advantages of the web over regular mobile applications. 
* Mozilla Reps take part in all sorts of open source activity and most of them are well known among the Israeli community.
* This photo below was taken when the stand was not crowded, otherwise the stand was simply hidden behind all the crowd.

## Mozilla Israel online

We are running three domains and two websites - 

* mozilla.org.il
* firefox.co.il / firefox.org.il

## firefox.co.il

* firefox.co.il
A domain that was donated to us. Acts as a landing page and doesn't have its own content besides mozilla.org content on the main frame and a frame with some localized links on top
* firefox.org.il
A domain that was donated to us. Links to mozilla.org. We don't really have an idea what to place there…

[![firefox.co.il](images/firefox.co.il.png)](http://firefox.co.il)

## mozilla.org.il

Our main site. Has a news section (based on WordPress) and an active support forum (phpBB).

[![Screenshot of mozilla.org.il](images/mozilla-il_website.png)](http://mozilla.org.il)

The site has a few static pages which are outdated for few years now, but we placed a script that update version information and download links based on the products version API from mozilla.org.

We want to convert the site to the new design at some point in the future and update some of the site content.

## Social presence 

   * [Facebook]     (https://facebook.com/MozillaIsrael) (1600 likes)
   * [Twitter]      (https://twitter.com/MozillaIsrael) (200+ followers)
   * [Google Plus]  (https://plus.google.com/+MozillaIsrael) (70 members)

Google Plus is mostly abandoned because it requires manual updating. 

Twitter and Facebook aggregate new posts from our site, as well as forum threads that receive after they pass a specified replies threshold using a custom script.
